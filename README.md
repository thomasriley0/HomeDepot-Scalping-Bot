# Home-Depot-Scalping-Bot
This is a python script to monitor the stock of a specific product and automatically purchase the desired quantity when the product is in stock. The script works by first logging into a home depot account and saving the cookies into a session object. Afte the session cookies are intialized, the script will scrape all the product links in products.txt and monitor the status of the stock for each item. When a particular item comes into stock, the bot will attempt to add the item to the cart, switch to a specific store location to achieve a price discount and purchase the item.
